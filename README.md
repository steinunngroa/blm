### A Bayesian Linear Regression package

Bayesian linear regression is a way of doing linear regression, where bayesian statistics are used to do the prediction.

This package is built in R to do Bayesian linear regression, as a part of the course: Data Science in Bioinformatics: Software Development and Testing, in Aarhus University 2016. The goal of the project was to see the various aspects that go into building an R package.
